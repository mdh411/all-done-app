# AllDone (Todo List Application)
This is a to-do list application for ADA SQA (Software Quality Assurance) Week 2 assignment

## Project Description

This project is a simple to-do list application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, ensuring they can stay organized and productive. The concept is broad and can aid users in achieving any goal including fitness, financial and social, limited only by their imagination. It includes user authentication to secure user data and ensures only authorized access to personal task lists. The UI is simple, intuitive and scalable as more tasks are added.

### Key Features
1. User Authentication
    * Secure login process with JWT-based authentication.
2. Task Management
    * Create Tasks
    * Delete Tasks
    * Edit Tasks
    * Mark tasks as completed to keep track of progress.

## Team Description
This was a solo project. As a result, I took the opportunity to embody multiple roles within the SDLC. 

Key Roles and Responsibilities:

## Tools Used

### Version Control
* Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions

Git is the industry standard for version control within modern software development projects like mine. GitHub was selected as a host for the repository as it facilitated seamless pull requests and code review. It also contains an inbuilt CICD mechanism: GitHub Actions. This allowed me to accomplish all my development objectives within one platform.

### Testing
**Backend Testing:**
* Pytest

This testing framework was ideal for our Flask-based backend because it supports fixtures for setting up and tearing down test environments easily, and its simple syntax allows for efficient test writing and maintenance.

**Frontend Testing:**
* Jest
* React Testing Library

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that works well with React, providing a comprehensive solution for unit and integration testing. On the other hand, React Testing Library focuses on testing React components from a user's perspective, ensuring that the app behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.

### Backend
* Programming language: Python
* Framework: Flask
* Libraries used: Flask JWT Extended, Flask CORS

Python's simplicity and readability made it an excellent choice for developing the backend, enabling rapid development and easy maintenance. Flask's lightweight and modular nature allowed for building a scalable and flexible backend. Itâ€™s perfect for small to medium-sized applications like our To-Do list app.

Flask JWT Extended provided robust and secure JWT-based authentication, which is essential for managing user sessions in a modern web app. Flask CORS simplified the handling of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend and backend to communicate seamlessly despite being on different origins.

### Frontend
* Programming Language: Javascript
* Framework: React
* Libraries used: Axios (for HTTP requests), React Router DOM, React Modal

Javascript and React and ubiquitous in web development and make for a responsive, dynamic, and highly modular frontend. I also, used Axios for HTTP requests to the backend.

### Linting
* ESLint
* Stylelint

ESLint and Stylelint were used to ensure code quality, consistency in logic and styling. This kept us adherent to a set standard.

### Other tools

I used **Trello** for project management, as it works well for Kanban. It's boards, lists and cards were useful when tracking progress within my workflow. Moreover, I ran a comprehensive accessibility audit using  **Google Lighthouse**. It provided me with accessibility, performance, SEO, and best practices, helping to identify and fix issues.

## Instructions to Run and Use the Application

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:
* Python (version 3.11 or higher)
* Node.js and npm (Node.js version 14.x or higher, npm version 6.x or higher)
* Poetry (for Python dependency management)

### How to Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine by running this command:

```git clone https://github.com/mdh411/all-done-app.git```

### How to Setup and Run Backend and Frontend
* Navigate to the backend directory using ```cd backend```
* start the backend Flask server by running ```poetry run flask run```

To setup the frontend:
* Navigate to the frontend directory using ```cd ../frontend```
* Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies
* Start React server using ```npm start```

### How to Lint
* Lint python code using ```poetry run flake8```
* Lint frontend code using ```npm run lint```
* Stylelint using ```npm run lint:styles```

### How to Run Tests
* Test backend using ```poetry run pytest```
* Test frontend using ```npm test```

### App Features
The app has several features, whereby users can:
* Securely login to their personal tasklist
* Click on 'Add Task', which will open a modal for them to add and submit a new task
* Click on the 'Edit' icon for a task to open a modal for them to edit their selected task
* Click on the 'Delete' icon to remove a task from their list
* Click the 'Checkbox' to mark a task as done. This will reflect in the row being greyed out and the text having a ~~strikethrough~~

## Project Workflow
For this project, a combination of agile methodologies and project management tools were used to ensure an efficient and organized workflow.

### Kanban Board
Trello was used to manage tickets and track progress. Tasks were organized into different columns such as "To Do", "In Progress", "Code Review", "Testing' and "Done". Each task was represented as a card that could be moved across columns as the task progressed. I outlined the tickets with their Acceptance Criteria to guide my development, which gave me a clear 'definition of done'. This gave me a clear visual representation of where the project stood.

### Agile Ceremonies
I adopted a somewhat unconventional agile approach as I was working independently but I took benefit from the flexibility of agile to incrementally build my application within a one-week sprint. It kept me open to changing priorities as I progressed with development.

Prior to implementation, I researched the tools and libraries best suited for my project needs. Next, I did a sprint plan using my Kanban board to prioritise tickets. I conducted daily self-reviews to evaluate positives and areas of improvement in my approach and implementation. These kept me focused, accountable, and acted as both standups and retrospectives. I documented any insights (using Google Docs) to mould future work.
