# AllDone (Todo List Application)
This is a to-do list application for ADA SQA (Software Quality Assurance) Week 2 assignment

## Project Description

This project is a simple to-do list application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, ensuring they can stay organized and productive. The concept is broad and can aid users in achieving any goal including fitness, financial and social, limited only by their imagination. It includes user authentication to secure user data and ensures only authorized access to personal task lists. The UI is simple, intuitive and scalable as more tasks are added.

### Key Features
1. User Authentication
    * Secure login process with JWT-based authentication.
2. Task Management
    * Create Tasks
    * Delete Tasks
    * Edit Tasks
    * Mark tasks as completed to keep track of progress.

## Team Description
This was a solo project. As a result, I took the opportunity to embody multiple roles within the SDLC. 

Key Roles and Responsibilities:

## Tools Used

### Version Control
* Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions

Git is the industry standard for version control within modern software development projects like mine. GitHub was selected as a host for the repository as it facilitated seamless pull requests and code review. It also contains an inbuilt CICD mechanism: GitHub Actions. This allowed me to accomplish all my development objectives within one platform.

### Testing
**Backend Testing:**
* Pytest

This testing framework was ideal for our Flask-based backend because it supports fixtures for setting up and tearing down test environments easily, and its simple syntax allows for efficient test writing and maintenance.

**Frontend Testing:**
* Jest
* React Testing Library

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that works well with React, providing a comprehensive solution for unit and integration testing. On the other hand, React Testing Library focuses on testing React components from a user's perspective, ensuring that the app behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.

### Backend
* Programming language: Python
* Framework: Flask
* Libraries used: Flask JWT Extended, Flask CORS

Python's simplicity and readability made it an excellent choice for developing the backend, enabling rapid development and easy maintenance. Flask's lightweight and modular nature allowed for building a scalable and flexible backend. Itâ€™s perfect for small to medium-sized applications like our To-Do list app.

Flask JWT Extended provided robust and secure JWT-based authentication, which is essential for managing user sessions in a modern web app. Flask CORS simplified the handling of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend and backend to communicate seamlessly despite being on different origins.

### Frontend
* Programming Language: Javascript
* Framework: React
* Libraries used: Axios (for HTTP requests), React Router DOM, React Modal

Javascript and React and ubiquitous in web development and make for a responsive, dynamic, and highly modular frontend. I also, used Axios for HTTP requests to the backend.

### Linting
* ESLint
* Stylelint

ESLint and Stylelint were used to ensure code quality, consistency in logic and styling. This kept us adherent to a set standard.

### Other tools
I used **Trello** for project management, as it works well for Kanban. It's boards, lists and cards were useful when tracking progress within my workflow. Moreover, I ran a comprehensive accessibility audit using  **Google Lighthouse**. It provided me with accessibility, performance, SEO, and best practices, helping to identify and fix issues.
