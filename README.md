## Plan

### Unit Testing
Backend: Use pytest for unit testing Flask routes.
Frontend: Use jest and react-testing-library for React component testing.

### Integration Testing
Backend: Test the integration of different routes and ensure data consistency.
Frontend: Test the interaction between components and the API.

### End-to-End Testing
Use Cypress for end-to-end testing of the application.
Create tests to cover critical user flows (e.g., creating, updating, and deleting tasks).
